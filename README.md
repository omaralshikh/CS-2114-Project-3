# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project-3


In this project, your goal is to implement your own LinkedStack and solve the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion. 
Using the algorithm as described in your textbook, you will solve a puzzle, step by step, and display your moves in a Window

The design of this project separates the front-end and the back-end. The back-end extends Observable and the front-end extends Observer. 
This design allows for separation of responsibility for the front and back ends which increases cohesion and reduces coupling. 
When there is a change in the observable back-end, the front-end observer is notified and can update the display accordingly
